# Apex Fusion (Local)

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a Work In Progress and is subject to changes

Home Assistant custom integration for local (LAN) polling of an Apex controller.

If you’ve tried other Apex options and found gaps (cloud dependence, stale support, or missing local REST/module support), I’d love feedback on what you need—this project aims to close those gaps with a local-first approach.

Contributors are welcome (issues, testing feedback, and PRs).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is not affiliated with Neptune Systems and has no connection to the Apex Fusion
> cloud service. It communicates only with the controller on your local network.
>
> Use at your own discretion. Firmware updates are applied via Neptune’s workflow, and this
> project cannot guarantee update safety. You assume all risk, including potential device
> malfunction or warranty implications.

## Features

- REST-first polling with legacy (CGI) fallback
- Config flow (UI setup)
- Input/probe sensors (Temp, pH, Cond, Trident results, etc)
- Digital inputs as binary sensors (leak/float switches, etc)
- Output control via 3-way selects (Off / Auto / On)
- Firmware update entities (controller + modules)
- Trident waste/reagent support (levels + alerts + controls, when a Trident is present)
- Designed for stable device identity and robust backoff on rate limiting

## Tested / Intended Hardware

This integration is designed for Neptune Apex controllers reachable on your LAN.

- **Written for** controllers that expose the local REST API (for example: `GET /rest/status`, `GET /rest/config`).
- **Fallback support** for legacy/older firmwares that only expose `GET /cgi-bin/status.xml` (best-effort).
- **Developed against** real controller payloads including a Trident module (Trident container level sensors are only created when a Trident is detected).

If your controller/modules behave differently, please consider contributing a redacted dump (see Development below) so support can be expanded safely.

### Known working (my setup)

As of 2026-01-31, I actively run this integration against:

- **Controller type:** AC6J (A3 Apex Jr)
- **Firmware:** 5.12J_CA25
- **APIs available:** REST (`/rest/*`) is expected; legacy CGI endpoints (`/cgi-bin/status.*`) may also be present and are used only as fallback
- **Modules observed via REST:**
  - FMM (Software Version: **24**)
  - MXM (Software Version: **1**)
  - Trident ACM (`TRI`) (Software Version: **23**)
  - PM2 (Software Version: **3**)
  - VDM (Software Version: **13**)

## Installation

### HACS (Custom Repository)

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a Work In Progress and is subject to changes. It will be added to HACS once complete.

<del>

1. HACS → Integrations → 3-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add this repository URL as **Integration**
3. Install **Apex Fusion (Local)**
4. Restart Home Assistant

</del>

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/apex_fusion` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/apex_fusion` folder, then restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Add the integration from Home Assistant UI:

1. Settings → Devices & services → Add integration
2. Search for **Apex Fusion (Local)**

    > [!TIP]
    > `admin` (default password `1234`) is recommended because it's commonly preconfigured, but it is not required.
    >
    > Best practice is to create a **dedicated Apex account** for Home Assistant and avoid using the same account in the
    > Apex **local web UI** at the same time (shared local logins can cause session conflicts).
    >
    > If you run more than one local integration / Home Assistant instance against the same controller, use **separate
    > Apex accounts** for each.

## Entities

This integration provides entities across these Home Assistant platforms:

- **Sensors**
  - Probes/inputs from the controller (temperature, pH, conductivity, Trident readings, etc)
  - Trident container levels from `status.modules[].extra.levels` (mL)
    - Trident Waste Used (mL)
    - Trident Reagent A/B/C Remaining (mL)
    - Trident Auxiliary Level (mL)
- **Binary sensors**
  - Digital inputs (leak/float switches)
  - Trident Testing (when a Trident is present)
  - Trident Waste Full (when a Trident is present)
  - Trident Reagent A/B/C Empty (when a Trident is present)
- **Selects**
  - One select per controllable output: Off / Auto / On
  - Sends control via the local REST API (`PUT /rest/status/outputs/<did>`)
- **Switches**
  - Feed Mode switches: Feed A / Feed B / Feed C / Feed D
  - Turning a feed switch **on** starts that feed cycle (timer).
  - Turning a feed switch **off** cancels the active feed cycle.
  - Control is REST-first (`PUT /rest/status/feed/<id>`), with legacy CGI fallback (`POST /cgi-bin/status.cgi`).
- **Buttons**
  - Refresh Config Now (controller)
  - Trident Prime Reagent A/B/C + Prime Sample
  - Trident Reset Reagent A/B/C + Reset Waste
- **Numbers**
  - Trident Waste Container Size (mL)
- **Updates**
  - Controller firmware update entity, named by controller type (example: `AC6J Firmware`)
  - Module firmware update entities (FMM, PM2, VDM, TRI, etc)

### Naming & Uniqueness (important)

Home Assistant entity_ids must be globally unique within your HA instance.

This integration intentionally prefixes **suggested entity IDs** with a tank/controller slug derived from the controller hostname (spaces/underscores normalized), so you can:

- Run **multiple Apex controllers** in one HA instance without entity_id collisions.
- Re-add / migrate controllers without accidentally reusing old entity IDs.

Notes:

- This affects **entity_id** (used in automations), not the entity's display name.
- Home Assistant only applies suggested IDs when an entity is first created, so upgrading may not change existing entity_ids automatically.
- To help existing installs, the integration includes a one-time entity-registry migration that prefixes existing entity_ids with the tank slug when safe.

If you rely on old entity_ids in automations, review the Entity Registry after upgrading.

### Config Refresh

Config is larger and changes less frequently than status, so it is refreshed on a slower cadence than `/rest/status`.

If you need config changes to show up immediately (including after using Trident control entities), use the controller button entity "Refresh Config Now" to force an immediate `/rest/config` refresh.

### Entity attributes (examples)

Select entities expose useful attributes for dashboards/automations:

```yaml
state: Auto
options: Off, Auto, On
state_code: TBL
mode: AUTO
effective_state: On
output_id: 12
type: MXMPump|AI|Axis
gid: 0
status: TBL, , Cnst, OK
icon: mdi:pump
friendly_name: 80g_Frag_Tank AI Axis (Axis 90)
```

```yaml
State: Off
options: Off, Auto, On
state_code: AON
mode: AUTO
percent: 100
effective_state: On
output_id: 21
type: serial
gid: null
status: AON, 100, OK,
icon: mdi:power-socket-us
friendly_name: 80g_Frag_Tank WhtLED 6 6
```

Binary sensors have attributes like:

```yaml
state: off
value: 0
type: digital
device_class: opening
icon: mdi:toggle-switch-outline
friendly_name: 80g_Frag_Tank Level
```

Sensors have attributes like:

```yaml
state: 33.6
state_class: measurement
unit_of_measurement: ppt
icon: mdi:flash
friendly_name: 80g_Frag_Tank Cond
```

Diagnostic sensors expose network/controller state (examples):

```yaml
DHCP Enabled: On
Gateway: 10.0.30.1
IP Address: 10.0.30.40
Last Alert Statement: Unknown
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Wi-Fi Enabled: On
Wi-Fi Quality: 99.0%
Wi-Fi SSID: MySSID-IoT-2.4
Wi-Fi Strength: 100.0%
```

## Firmware Updates

Home Assistant has a first-class Update platform; this integration exposes firmware
updates there.

> Important: The Update entities are **informational only**. This integration does not
> initiate or install firmware updates. Apply firmware updates using Neptune’s own
> workflow (Fusion/app/controller UI).

- **Controller update** uses controller-reported values (prefers sanitized config from `/rest/config` when
  available, otherwise `/rest/status`):
  - Installed version from `system.software`
  - Latest version from `nconf.latestFirmware` / `nstat.latestFirmware`
  - Update flag from `nconf.updateFirmware` / `nstat.updateFirmware`
- **Module update** support varies by firmware. This integration uses (in priority order):
  - Module config flags from sanitized config (from `/rest/config`) when present
  - Module status signals from `/rest/status.modules[]` (`swrev` and `swstat`)

If a module doesn't report a concrete latest version, the integration will still surface
useful state:

- `swstat: OK` -> assumes up-to-date (latest == installed)
- `swstat: UPDATE` -> reports update available even if no version string is provided

## Trident Support

When a Trident module is present (`hwtype: TRI`), the integration exposes:

- Trident Status sensor
- Trident Testing binary sensor
- Trident container levels (mL) from `modules[].extra.levels`
- Trident Waste Full + Trident Reagent A/B/C Empty binary sensors
- Trident controls: Prime (A/B/C/Sample), Reset Reagent (A/B/C), Reset Waste
- Trident Waste Container Size number entity (mL)

Some firmwares also expose Trident **selector outputs** (for example names like `Trident_5_3` / `Alk_5_4`).
When present, they appear as output mode selects (Off/Auto/On). Setting them to **On** may initiate the corresponding test, depending on firmware.

## Development

- Create and use `.venv`
- Run tests: `.venv/bin/pytest -q`
- Lint: `.venv/bin/ruff check .`
- Optional (commit messages): `pip install -r requirements.txt` then run `cz commit` for an interactive Conventional Commit prompt

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome. The goal of this integration is to stay compatible with Home Assistant **LATEST** and to only expose entities backed by stable, controller-provided values.

Before opening a PR:

- Run tests: `.venv/bin/pytest -q`
- Run lint: `.venv/bin/ruff check .`
- If you change parsing/entity behavior, include updated/added pytest coverage (PRs that break tests won’t be accepted).

If your change depends on real controller payloads (new module support, missing fields, firmware differences), a redacted device dump is the fastest way to validate behavior (see the Device dump helper below). Please do not commit unredacted dumps.

### Device dump helper

The repo includes a local-only helper script for collecting controller payloads to help add support for additional devices/modules:

- Dump one controller (redacted by default): `python3 apex_dev.py dump --ip 192.168.1.50`
- Scan a subnet (noisy; use carefully): `python3 apex_dev.py scan --cidr 192.168.1.0/24`

Notes:

- Dumps are written under `.dev/dumps/` by default (gitignored).
- Redaction is enabled by default. Set `APEX_REDACT=0` only if you understand the risks.
- You can provide credentials via `--username/--password` or `APEX_USERNAME`/`APEX_PASSWORD` (optionally in a `.env`).
